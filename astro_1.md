## Optical Astronomy Research

**An investigation into photometric emissions of low-mass stellar objects via observational data from the WIYN 0.9m optical telescope in Kitt Peak, AZ.**

My research group at the Five College Astronomy Department took photometric images in the Hα wavelength (665nm), and Hα continuum narrowband (666nm), to provide us with data to study light curves produced by varying flux in the Hα band. I analyzed the morphology of such curves and comparing objects of different masses, ages, and disk types to deepen our understanding of how stellar and substellar objects in their earliest stages change over time

Language: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, photutils, astropy, scipy)

Primary skills: data cleaning, data pipeline creation, data visualization, data analysis (time domain analysis,), data management

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
