## Optical Astronomy Research

**An investigation into photometric emissions of low-mass stellar objects via observational data from the WIYN 0.9m optical telescope in Kitt Peak, AZ.**

My research group at the Five College Astronomy Department took photometric images in the Hα wavelength (665nm), and Hα continuum narrowband (666nm), to provide us with data to study light curves produced by varying flux in the Hα band. I analyzed the morphology of such curves and comparing objects of different masses, ages, and disk types to deepen our understanding of how stellar and substellar objects in their earliest stages change over time

Tools: Jupyter/Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, photutils, astropy, scipy), Excel, Astrometry, SAOImageDS9

Primary skills: data cleaning, data pipeline creation, data visualization, data analysis, data management
