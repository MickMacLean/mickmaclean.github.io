**Using rotational transitions of CH₃CCH to confirm the temperature of the S140 gas cloud with previously taken data from the FCRAO telescope in Massachusetts.**
I ultilized data from an observing run from 2006 from the now defunct FCRAO telescope in order to see if the data confirms the previously known temperature of a gas cloud. 

Methyl Acetylene (CH₃CCH) is a non-linear molecule, needing more than one quantum number in order to describe its angular momentum; CH₃CCH happens to be a symmetric top molecule and has a 3-fold symmetry that allows its angular momentum to be described with two quantum numbers.
The two quantum numbers measure each of the two moments of inertia for CH₃CCH, one of which being the total rotational angular momentum (J), and the other being the rotational angular momentum about the symmetry axis (K).
When K = 0, the molecule will not be rotating about the symmetry axis at all. When K = J, all of the molecules rotational angular momentum will be about its symmetry axis.

The dipole moment for CH₃CCH is along the symmetry axis which means that electromagnetic radiation can not exert a torque on the molecule along that axis.
This means that EM radiation can not affect the K quantum number and the value of K for the CH₃CCH molecule is only changed by collisions with other molecules, ie. temperature.
A population of  CH₃CCH molecules with similar K values are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the population size is only determined by the temperature of the gas. (K-ladder)

By measuring the different intensities of a change in J for different K-ladders, the intensities can be compared and used to calculate the temperature of the gas cloud these molecules are found in.
This experiment uses data gathered from the core of gas cloud S140 and looks at the J = 6 to J = 5 transition of CH₃CCH at four different K-ladders

### The Data
Data was from the core of the S140 gas cloud and looks at the J = 6  and J = 5 rotational transition of CH3CCH
Used a gaussian fit to fit the data
Found the intensities for 23 of the spectra, which had a good fit to clearly show the four peaks in the data
The intensities of the spectra were used to find the ratios between the K = 0 to    K = 1, K = 2, and K = 3 transitions
The ratios were used to find the values of temperature
