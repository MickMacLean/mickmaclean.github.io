## BTS Database Project

### Project at a glance
**Construct a database with data on every BTS song such that the data will be in an easily comparable format.** 

방탄소년단, Bangtan Sonyeondan, also known as BTS, is a South Korean boyband under Big Hit Entertainment whose extensive and diverse discography has garnered them a plethora of awards and millions of passionate fans dedicated to their socially-conscious music. 

With over 350 songs, their discography presents a prime opportunity to collect and explore data and its trends further.

As an avid fan myself, I am interested in understanding their music lyrically and emotionally, and as someone passionate about data, I'm interested in the analytics of their music. My main goal is to construct a database where I can store data in an easily comparable format to serve as an encyclopedia of information, as well as provide a simple way to compare the stats of each song, category, and query based on tags.
Construct a user-friendly website to display these data for fans to access and use for their own purposes.
Want data in an easily comparable format, serve as an encyclopedia of information.

**Tools:** SQL, Tableau Public, Excel

**Primary skills:** data collection, data management, databases, 

### The Data
The data to be included for each song is as follows:
  - Song title, English and Korean/Japanese
  - Release date
  - Album(s) on which it is included
  - Writers
  - Producers
  - Choreographers
  - Singers
  - Genre
  - Themes
  - Remixes
  - Awards, nominated and received 
  - Performances, where and when
  - Streams, first week and current
  - Music video
  
Much of this data must be collected manually as there is no central site which contains all of the data to be included. Data currently taken from Korea Music Copyright Assosiation (KOMCA), Genius, Hypable, and the official Spotify and YouTube of the band.
Example dataset with information; one album of information is displayed below.

This project is in its early stages of development.
